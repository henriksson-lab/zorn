# Compiling Bascet

Bascet is located [in a separate Github repository](https://github.com/henriksson-lab/bascet)

You first need to [download rust](https://rustup.rs)

To download Bascet and get the Rust dependencies:

```{console, eval=F, echo=T}
git clone https://github.com/henriksson-lab/bascet.git   
#or: git clone git@github.com:henriksson-lab/bascet.git   

cd bascet
make install_rust  #this will install rust nightly build -- only need to do this once
```

To compile Bascet, you just run "make" whenever you make a change:

```{console, eval=F, echo=T}
cd bascet
make
```


# Editing the Bascet code

To modify the code, we recommend [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)
and in particular, install the
[rust code extensions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/rust).

This setup enables you to see compile errors and get hints while coding!




# Accessing a locally compiled Bascet in Zorn

You can do this to link to your own Rust binary:

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
bascetInstance.default <- BascetInstance(
  bin="/path/to/bascet/target/debug/bascet",
  tempdir="./"
)
```

If you want access to all the software in Docker/Singularity, you can also pass
an image; while Bascet is present, providing an absolute path like above will
override it.
