# Simulated data

To test the pipeline, we have prepared a simulated dataset at (TODO upload)

You can also simulate your own data, to, e.g., check performance on genomes that
you might expect in a sample. This can be useful for power calculations/estimation.
See [the Zorn github repo](https://github.com/henriksson-lab/zorn/tree/main/simulate).
Note that the simulation scripts are for developers primarily, and likely have
rough corners. Please get in touch if you have a need of this and need directions
on how to use the code.


# Real data
