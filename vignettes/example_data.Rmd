# Simulated data

To test the pipeline, we have prepared (a simulated dataset)[http://beagle.henlab.org/public/bascet/demodata/simulated.zip].
This is is not raw data, but rather what you get after shardification. If you follow
the tutorial, the first steps are thus already done.

You can also simulate your own data, to, e.g., check performance on genomes that
you might expect in a sample. This can be useful for power calculations/estimation.
See [the Zorn github repo](https://github.com/henriksson-lab/zorn/tree/main/simulate).
Note that the simulation scripts are for developers primarily, and likely have
rough corners. Please get in touch if you have a need of this and need directions
on how to use the code.


# Real data

You can also investigate some (miseq data)[http://beagle.henlab.org/public/bascet/demodata/miseq.zip].
Note that this data is ultra-shallowly sequenced, so don't expect to see much.
But there is a great number of barcodes which will stress test some parts of
Zorn/Bascet without the need for a large computational cluster.
