If you want to analyze bulk samples (e.g. isolates) with Zorn/Bascet, this is
absolutely possible, and you then get the benefits of
1. a workflow manager
2. a suite of analysis tools 
3. fewer files to manage

Depending on your use case, there are two ways to do this:

# If you have a few input FASTQ or FASTA files

There are two special file formats, "list-fastq" and "list-fasta", which is a TSV that simply consists of
* A name for each sample
* Links to raw FASTQ-files or FASTA-files

This file can be used in place of a Bascet TIRP or ZIP-file, e.g., as the source
of filtered reads. In effect, you skip debarcoding and sharding.

TODO file format example





# If you have really many FASTA/FASTQ files

In this case we recommend you to produce TIRP files yourself, in a way that
makes sense based on your infrastructure. See the section on file formats to learn
how to produce it. You can easily append one input file after another, and thus
avoid the need to keep all files on disk at the same time.



# Mixing single-cell and bulk samples

Bascet currently does not support multiple input file formats for a given stage;
i.e. if you have filtered reads, they must all be in TIRP format, or another format.

The easiest way to mix samples is to
1. Perform debarcoding and sharding of your single-cell data into TIRP
2. In a separate working directory for bulk data, use Bascet transform to convert a list-FASTQ/FASTA to TIRP
3. Copy this bulk TIRP as filtered.xxx.tirp.gz in your single-cell directory, where xxx is the next number after your current single-cell shards
