Zorn and Bascet can do many things:
* Preprocess reads for single-cell metagenomics, WGS and RNA-seq
* Perform de novo assembly and other tasks relevant for whole-genome sequencing
* Perform custom per-cell detailed analysis operations

The interface is designed to interoperate with Signac and Seurat for high-level
analysis of the data, after the preprocessing.


Depending on your use case, you will need different tutorials. However,
these are in common for all workflows:

* [Installing Zorn and Bascet](install.html)
* [Using SLURM](slurm.html) - If you want to run this in a high-performance environment
* [Debarcoding tutorial](debarcoding.html) - Ingesting raw FASTQ and preparing for later steps


The next step to get an overview is likely:

* [KRAKEN-based workflow](kraken.html) - if you don't know what your sample contains, and want to compare to known species
* [De novo KMER-based workflow](kmer.html) - if you don't know what your sample contains, and want to find novel genome compositions
* [Alignment-based workflow](alignment.html) - if you have some clue what your sample contains

Then there are several options on how to continue with deeper analysis:

* [Clustering](clustering.html) - to visualize your samples
* [De novo assembly](assembly.html)
* [Running software for each cell using MAP](map_scripts.html) - Such as QC analysis etc

These may help you understand Zorn and Bascet better

* [Overview of file formats](fileformats.html)
* [For developers](for_developers.html) - if you wish to modify Bascet
