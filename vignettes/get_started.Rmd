Zorn and Bascet can do many things:
* Preprocess reads for single-cell metagenomics, WGS and RNA-seq
* Perform de novo assembly and other tasks relevant for whole-genome sequencing
* Perform custom per-cell detailed analysis operations

The interface is designed to interoperate with Signac and Seurat for high-level
analysis of the data, after the preprocessing.


Depending on your use case, you will need different tutorials. However,
these are in common for all workflows:

* [Installing Zorn and Bascet](install.html)
* [Using SLURM](slurm.html) - If you want to run this in a high-performance environment
* [Debarcoding tutorial](debarcoding.html) - Ingesting raw FASTQ and preparing for later steps


Then there are several options on how to continue:

* [KRAKEN-based workflow](kraken.html) - if you don't know what your sample contains
* [Alignment-based workflow](alignment.html) - if you have some clue what your sample contains


These may help you understand Zorn and Bascet better
