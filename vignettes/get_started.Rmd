Zorn and Bascet can do many things:
* Preprocess reads for single-cell metagenomics, WGS and RNA-seq
* Perform de novo assembly and other tasks relevant for whole-genome sequencing
* Perform custom per-cell detailed analysis operations

The interface is designed to interoperate with Signac and Seurat for high-level
analysis of the data, after the preprocessing.


Depending on your use case, you will need different tutorials. However,
these are in common for all workflows:

* [a link](install.html "Installing Zorn and Bascet")
* [a link](slurm.html "Using SLURM") - If you want to run this in a high-performance environment
* [a link](debarcoding.html "Debarcoding tutorial") - Ingesting raw FASTQ and preparing for later steps


Then there are several options on how to continue:

* [a link](kraken.html "KRAKEN-based workflow") - if you don't know what your sample contains
* [a link](alignment.html "Alignment-based workflow") - if you have some clue what your sample contains


These may help you understand Zorn and Bascet better
