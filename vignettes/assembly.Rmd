First set up your Zorn/Bascet work directory as before.

Assembly can then performed using SKESA, via the MapCell system:

[(SLURM-compatible step)](slurm.html)

```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
### Assemble all genomes
BascetMapCell(
  bascetRoot,
  withfunction = "_skesa",
  inputName = "filtered",
  outputName = "skesa",
  runner=bascet_runner,
  bascet_instance=bascet_instance
)
```

This produce contigs for each cell, all grouped together in "skesa". Note that
both skesa and spades only assembles cells for which there are sufficient number of reads.



```{r, eval=F, echo=T}

#TODO extract an individual genome

```




```{r, eval=F, echo=T}

#TODO QUAST for QC etc

```
