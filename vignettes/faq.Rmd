# If your questions is not here

# Can you help me wrap tool X?
Contact us; if it is a commonly used tool and the effort is low, we might be
able to rather quickly get it in. If it is a major endeavor, it might be a possible
task for a collaboration.

# How do I contribute?
There's a ton of tasks that we would be happy to get help with. Depending on the task,
it might be enough to just know R and some BASH; more difficult tasks requires you
to learn [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org), in which case it helps to at least have
written some Python (or even better; Java, C# or C++).

Some examples of tasks:

* Wrapping of commonly used tools
* Improved read trimming / support for other trimmers
* Improved barcode detection
* Support for other assemblers
* Support for other single-cell chemistries
* General speed improvements
