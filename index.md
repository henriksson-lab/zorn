## Zorn

We are proud to announce **Zorn, an R package and workflow manager for scalable single-cell analysis!**

To install Zorn, see the [install page](articles/install.html). 

To get started using Zorn, see the [manual](articles/get_started.html).

If you use Zorn in your research, please cite [our preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.06.20.660799v1).

Zorn is developed and maintained by the [HenLab](https://www.henlab.org/) and [CompMicroLab](https://www.microbe.dev/) at [Umeå University](https://www.umu.se/en/) in beautiful [Umeå, Sweden!](https://visitumea.se/en)

Most users want to use Zorn for all operations. However, if you want to expand on low-level functionality, you can have a look at the underlying software [Bascet](https://github.com/henriksson-lab/bascet/).



## News

* 2025-07-28: Version 0.4.0 has now been released. Please update Bascet to match this release. This update changes the GetRaw and Shardify commands to reduce memory consumption when working with large number of cells. Parse Biosciences scRNA-seq is now unofficially supported.
